When an objective has been met, the driver should push the code to the GitHub account, the observer should pull the changes, and the two partners switch roles. 

## Problems

*Note: Use const to hold any values that should not change*

1. Generate two random numbers, ask the user to calculate the sum of the numbers, and display if they got it right or not.
2. Ask the user for a radius and calulate and display the area of a circle with that radius. If the user enters a negative number, provide them with a warning message and do not calculate the answer.
3. Ask the user for their weight and height and calculate their BMI. Display both the number value and the range they fall in. Example: BMI: 22.5 Healthy
